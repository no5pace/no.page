TO-DO:
> transfer all major c, lua, and web projects onto Github and have them linked to on the website (if they're on Replit, also have that link)

Domain Names:
> no.page		(i really like this one)
> nah.space		(lol i like this one too)
> no5pace.dev	(on the nose but it gets the job done)

bascially this will be a website from which i host my discord bot and have general info about the stuff i do (links to github + replit)
thats about it for now

Plans:
> have general information on who i am, what i do, and where i can be contacted
> have a nice directory shelf on the side that is styled like a file manager which will navigate the site
> host discord bot from this website, and link to github + replit where there'll be invite links, and documentation for each bot
> share my projects + source code using github + replit 

Execution:
> make the discord bot lol
> figure out hosting lol (either Raspberry Pi [might run into site traffic issues] or a vps [subscription price issues])
	* possibly use both: Raspberry Pi hosting to get donation money --> use money to host on vps for better quality --> get more money
