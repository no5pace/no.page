TO-DO:
> get rid of the package.json files in each individual bot folder, and instead have a global one for the whole website
> add doctypes (they ruin the formatting for now, so figure that out sometime)

Domain Names:
[preferred]
> no5pace.dev	(on the nose but it gets the job done)
> no.page	(i really like this one)
> nah.space	(lol i like this one too)
> noo.space 	(a little bit of a stretch [haha] buts its preferred over the below)

[others]
> n0.space	(a little iffy with the 0)
> n0.dev	(^^^)
> no.blog	(it's not really a blog tho)

bascially this will be a website from which i host my discord bots and have general info about the stuff i do
thats about it for now

Plans:
> have general information on who i am, what i do, and where i can be contacted
> have a nice directory shelf on the side that is styled like a file manager which will navigate the site
> host discord bots from this website (nospa.ce/noBot && nospa.ce/remoteBot), have invite links, and documentation for each bot
> share my projects + source code from this site

Execution:
> learn how to make a website lol
> make the discord bots lol
> figure out hosting lol (either Raspberry Pi [might run into site traffic issues] or a vps [subscription price issues])
	* possibly use both: Raspberry Pi hosting to get donation money --> use money to host on vps for better quality --> get more money
